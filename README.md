C is a lovely language, these are experiments and notes working with it.  
### Current
pixels - bouncing pixels, using windows and rendering to create 2d graphics.  
comparison - file input/output, will do sorting and comparison of CPU clock cycles.  
notes - notes relating to various things.  
Mercury - basic shell.  
Venus - nothing yet.  
ncurses - Similar to pixels, but using the ncurses library as opposed to SDL2
stopwatch - A stopwatch for timing CPU usage. Currently takes 1 argument for a main execution.

### To-do:  
-Package 'pixels' with SDL2 / ncurses with ncurses?
-Install SFML - import Rust pendulum form elsuizo.
-C pendulum?
-Fix/implement 'comparison' sorts.
-Implement stopwatch functionality throughout package.
