The pirate ship sailed under darkened skies.
Captain Blackbeard grinned at the helm, waiting.
"Hoist the sails!" he shouted to his brave crew.
The sea roared, waves crashed on the old ship.
"We're bound for treasure," the captain roared.
The crew cheered, gold filling their wild dreams.
Suddenly, a ship loomed on the horizon ahead.
"Prepare for battle!" Blackbeard shouted loud.
Cannonballs whizzed through the salty, cold air.
Wood splintered as the ships collided hard.
But Blackbeard's crew fought fierce, unafraid.
"Board them!" yelled the captain, sword raised.
Pirates swung across ropes, landing with force.
With a mighty clash, the battle raged wildly.
Victory was near as the enemy started to flee.
"We've won!" the crew cheered, treasure in sight.
Gold coins gleamed under the bright pirate moon.
Blackbeard smiled, fortune was finally theirs.
