Mercury will be a project focused on creating a shell.

What the program needs to do:
-Read user input.
-Parse user input for commands.
-Execute the input commands.

Reading:
-We will read in input using fgets() or getline()
-Clean up the input

Parsing:
-Use a delimiter to split the input into an array of strings.
-Use strtok() to tokenize strings with spaces being our delimiter.

Execution:
-Create a child process using fork().
-Use execvp() to run the command, display an error if it cannot be run.
-The shell should wait for the command to be executed with wait().

Built-in commands:
-Change directory with chdir()
-Call exit() to terminate shell.

Issues:

1. readInput - Input past 6 characters begin to behave oddly.
It wouldn't read the 7th character, and anything beyond would be put into new lines (new buffers?).
PROBLEM - My fgets call was incorrect. fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin). This meant I was only
allocating 8 bytes (the size of a pointer variable) to my input, hence why the 7th character misbehaved.
SOLUTION - I added a new size_t argument to the function, and the shellLoop passes the actual space to the function.
Now the fgets is: fgets(buffer, bufferSize, stdin) - Which properly allocates the correct amount of space.
